# Elections_Analysis

## Project Overview

A Colorado election board employee, Tom, asked for my help with an election audit totaling results of congressional precinct in Colorado. Tom asked if I could complete the following task:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election – Audit Results

        Total Votes: 369,711

 ## Election-Audit Summary

The script that I created to produce the election results requested is multifaceted. It produced results showing the total number of votes cast, the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct, which county had the largest votes, the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received, and the total number of votes and percentage of votes the winning candidate received. 

The script can also be modified to import other types of data and produce requested output results. For example, instead of elections results the script can produce college testing results. All that must be changed is the imported data sourcrm, some of the coding parameters in the script like candidate_name to student_name and election_results to college_testing_results.
